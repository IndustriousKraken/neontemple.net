Red teamers, blue teamers, purple teamers, and the occasional chaos agent. We work at startups, enterprises, and places we can't talk about.

We meet weekly. The content is substantive: live exploitation, defense techniques, tool deep-dives, career strategy. If you've been to other "security meetups" and left wondering when the actual security would start, this is different.

Members look out for each other. When someone's ready to move or gets caught in a layoff, the network activates. We're plugged into the companies our members own and work for. That's not a pitch—it's just what happens when you put this many practitioners in a room together every week.
