## What we do

Weekly meetings with hands-on content: penetration testing demos, malware analysis, defensive tooling, CTF practice, career workshops. We run training sessions, host guest speakers from the industry, and maintain an active Discord where the conversation continues between meetings.

## Who we are

Our membership skews heavily toward practitioners—people actively working in offensive and defensive security roles. Red team is unusually well-represented here, but we've got blue and purple teamers, GRC folks, security engineers, and a handful of entrepreneurs building security companies.

Members work across the spectrum: consulting firms, enterprises, startups, and cleared government positions. The common thread is that everyone here actually does the work.

## The network effect

When you put experienced security professionals in a room every week, things happen. Job referrals are constant—members frequently hire each other or connect each other with opportunities. We have relationships with the companies our members own and work for. It's not formal; it's just what a functioning professional community looks like.

## Sponsors

The guild is supported by sponsors who contribute beyond standard membership dues. This keeps costs low and lets us focus on content rather than fundraising. Sponsor companies provide meeting space, training resources, and scholarship funding for members pursuing certifications.

## The scholarship

The WEAR ABLE Security Scholarship, created in partnership with Dr. Sunny Wear and Ransomwear, provides funding for Tampa Bay infosec students to pursue training courses, certifications, or college classes. Recipients also get membership access to the guild.

## Location

Tampa Bay, Florida. Meetings are held weekly at our sponsor facility. Remote access available for those who can't make it in person.
