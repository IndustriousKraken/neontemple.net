Membership gets you access to weekly meetings, our private Discord, training sessions, and the network of security professionals who make up the guild.

We're not for everyone. If you're looking for a casual meetup where people talk about security in the abstract, there are other options. If you want to be in a room with practitioners who are actively breaking and defending systems, and you're ready to contribute—demos, talks, questions, answers—we'd like to meet you.

Membership includes:

- Weekly in-person meetings (remote option available)
- Private Discord access
- Member rates on training and events
- Access to the job network
- Voting rights on guild decisions
